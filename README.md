# Threadlab
Lab 5 CS 33 with Tony Nowatzski Fall 2022. Required us to optimize some histogram operations using multi-threading. I scored best in my class in terms of energy-delay improvement -> geomean 6.00 speedup using 8 threads across normal (8.6) and pathological case (4.2).
At the bottom are my notes and my attempts (successful) to use methods like semaphores, barriers, readers-writers blocks and to create additional threads and attempt even more parallelism.
